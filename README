# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to predict **house prices** using machine learning techniques with Python. The tutorial covers essential data science steps such as data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The dataset used is the **California Housing Dataset**, which is commonly used for regression tasks.

This project aims to provide a beginner-friendly yet comprehensive introduction to machine learning, while also diving into advanced concepts like **hyperparameter tuning** and **feature engineering**.

### Project Goals:

* Understand the process of data exploration and analysis
* Preprocess and clean data to make it ready for machine learning
* Engineer new features to improve model performance
* Train and evaluate models using machine learning algorithms like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**
* Optimize models using **hyperparameter tuning**

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are essential for building and evaluating the model:

* **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and analysis
* **`numpy`**: For numerical computations and handling arrays
* **`matplotlib` & `seaborn`**: For visualizing data distributions and relationships
* **`scikit-learn`**: For machine learning algorithms and tools (model building, evaluation, scaling, etc.)
* **`xgboost`**: (optional) For implementing gradient boosting algorithms in hyperparameter tuning

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. **Data Exploration**

* **Dataset Overview**: We start by loading the **California Housing dataset** and performing initial data exploration, which includes:

  * Checking the data types of features
  * Summary statistics for numeric columns
  * Visualizing the distribution of house prices and other variables
* **Correlations**: Understanding relationships between different features, such as the strong correlation between **median income** and **house value**.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

* **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing data points are handled using imputation or removal methods.
* **Feature Scaling**: Scaling numerical features, especially for algorithms like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**, is done using **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler** from **scikit-learn** to ensure proper model performance.
* **Data Encoding**: Categorical data is encoded appropriately (e.g., OneHotEncoding if needed).

### 3. **Feature Engineering**

* Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance. In this project:

  * We create new meaningful features (e.g., interaction between features like income and house age).
  * We drop irrelevant or redundant features to simplify the model and improve accuracy.
* Proper feature engineering can lead to more accurate and interpretable models.

### 4. **Model Building**

* **Linear Regression**: We first apply **Linear Regression**, a simple yet effective model for regression tasks, to establish a baseline.
* **Random Forest**: We then use **Random Forest** (an ensemble method) to improve performance and capture more complex relationships.
* Both models are evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared** to assess accuracy.

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

* **Random Forest Hyperparameters**: We tune important parameters such as **n\_estimators**, **max\_depth**, and **min\_samples\_split** using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** to find the best performing model.
* Hyperparameter tuning optimizes model performance and allows it to generalize better to unseen data.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**

* After tuning the models, we evaluate their performance on a validation set.
* The final model is then tested on the test data to check for overfitting or underfitting.

## Data Insights

* **Median Income vs. House Value**: A strong **positive correlation** exists between the median income of households and house prices. This means higher-income areas tend to have higher house values.
* **Latitude vs. House Value**: Latitude shows a **negative correlation** with house prices, which might be indicative of location-specific factors (e.g., coastal areas being more expensive).

These insights guide real estate decisions and can inform businesses or policymakers on factors that affect housing prices.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is critical to improving the predictive power of the model. In this project, feature engineering involves:

* **Combining existing features**: We create new features by combining variables that might have a meaningful relationship.
* **Handling outliers**: Removing or transforming extreme values in certain columns.
* **Temporal features**: Deriving useful features from the dataset (e.g., housing age, region).

### Why is Feature Engineering Important?

Feature engineering allows the model to learn better patterns and relationships between features. A well-engineered dataset can lead to **better model accuracy** and **improved predictions**.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

One of the key steps in improving a modelâ€™s performance is **hyperparameter tuning**. This process is important because:

* It allows you to optimize the **Random Forest** or other machine learning models.
* Helps adjust parameters like the **number of estimators**, **max depth**, and **learning rate** to prevent overfitting or underfitting.

### **Hyperparameter Tuning in Random Forest:**

* **Number of estimators (`n_estimators`)**: The number of trees in the forest. Increasing this generally improves model performance, but it also increases computational cost.
* **Maximum depth (`max_depth`)**: The maximum depth of the tree. Tuning this helps to control the complexity of the model.
* **Minimum samples split (`min_samples_split`)**: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. This prevents the model from overfitting.

* Data **exploration** and **preprocessing**

## Next Steps

* **Explore other models**: You could experiment with models like **XGBoost** or **Neural Networks** for potentially better results.
* **Deploy the model**: The model can be deployed as an API using **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
* **Improve data quality**: Look into additional data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
